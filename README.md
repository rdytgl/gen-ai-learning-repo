# RDYTGL's Code Portfolio

Welcome to my coding portfolio! I'm a graduating Management Engineering student shifting into the tech space—currently exploring computer science, data, and GenAI. This repository is a collection of personal projects, coursework, and experiments that reflect my learning journey and evolving interests.

## Projects

### 1. [CS50x Problem Sets](cs50x/)
A submodule of my currently completed [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/) submissions, showcasing foundational programming skills using C, Python, SQL, and web development tools.

### 2. ITMGT25 Adhoc Analysis
An exploratory data analysis project from my sophomore year, applying Python and pandas to extract business insights from structured datasets.

Included here are the following:
1. Codebase in analysing the data
2. PDFs explaining the results of the analysis and my thought process on how I eventually solved this problem

## About Me

I'm pivoting from business and operations research into tech—driven by a desire to solve real-world problems using data, systems thinking, and AI. I'm especially curious about how GenAI can change the way we work, learn, and connect.
